1. Run 
	gmx_mpi grompp -f NVT.mdp -c <conf>.gro -p topol.top -pp processed.top
   to get processed.top.
	Then modify the atom name of only solute in [atom] section of processed.top file with putting a undersocre (_) at the end, like CA will become CA_. (plumed recognise the atom name followed by underscore as solute.)
